(might decorate this later, just focusing on remaking my github somewhat)

hello! my name is fern, elliot, or jard, but i mainly prefer the first two! refer to me with only he/it and masc terms please, i do not use they/them

i mainly hang out at the roblox area, im likely only at another place on the map if my oomfs have lead me there (im not too familiar with the map......), sometimes im also at party island, but mostly if i dont feel like being around anyone besides closer friends who i feel ok with inviting to party

c+h is something i dont mind, but please, do not do it randomly if we dont know each other, its likely just gonna be me resulting in sounding very awkward and "dry" (as people like to call it)

i have a lot of interests, so [look at this rentry to see them all!](https://rentry.co/catjard) my main interest (or rather hyperfixation) at the moment is roblox point of no return (which, if you know of it, PLEASEEEEE feel free to talk to me about it)

i dont really do dni stuff, i mostly just will block whoever i dont wanna interact with as i find it to be more effective, but i feel a need to clarify this: please dooo not try interacting with me if you associate/are friends with alekay, aka xxjardxgalf-yaoi69xx on here, unless were already oomfs (as he makes me and others deeply uncomfortable), or if you ship jard x bobo/any ship in general with bobo (he is very much a real person who the devs say not to ship with anyone)

lastly, i can go offline for quite a bit sometimes, this doesnt mean ill be gone forever! its either im feeling too socially anxious to log on, taking a break, or both, feel free to ask for my discord which i pretty much always check (just i might not give it to you if we've interacted once or twice)

[more general interaction stuff can be found here!](https://rentry.co/billybloxxer) this readme mainly just talks about stuff i want people to see first, but /billybloxxer on rentry has more boundaries and stuff
